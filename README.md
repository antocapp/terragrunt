## Introduction

Infrastructure as code (IAC) is the practice of managing and provisioning infrastructure using code rather than manual processes. This approach enables teams to manage infrastructure more efficiently, consistently, and reliably. Terragrunt is an open-source tool that helps teams manage infrastructure as code in AWS. In this article, we'll show you how to use Terragrunt with Github Packages and Github Actions to manage infrastructure in AWS.

## Build and Push Terragrunt Image on Github Packages

Before we can use Terragrunt with Github Actions, we need to build and push a Terragrunt image to Github Packages. Github Packages is a package hosting service that allows you to publish and share packages with other developers. To build the Terragrunt image, we'll use a Dockerfile that installs the necessary dependencies and packages. Once the image is built, we'll push it to Github Packages so that we can use it in our Github Actions workflow.

## Write the CI/CD Pipeline on Github Actions

With the Terragrunt image available on Github Packages, we can now write the Github Actions workflow that will manage our infrastructure code. The workflow should include steps for checking out the code from our repository, building the Terragrunt image, configuring the AWS CLI with our access credentials, running Terragrunt to apply our infrastructure changes, and cleaning up any unused resources. We'll also use Github Actions to trigger the workflow based on events like code pushes or pull requests.

## Overview on Terragrunt Code

To manage infrastructure as code with Terragrunt, we'll need to write code that defines our AWS resources. We can use Terragrunt code to define resources like EC2 instances, RDS instances, and S3 buckets. Terragrunt also supports modules, which allow us to organize and reuse infrastructure code across different projects. In addition, Terragrunt supports dependency management, which means we can define dependencies between infrastructure resources and ensure they are created in the correct order.

## Create a Staging Organization Account on AWS and Trust Relationship with Prod Account

To demonstrate how to use Terragrunt to manage infrastructure in AWS, we'll create a staging environment in a separate AWS account. We'll also set up a trust relationship between the staging and production accounts to enable cross-account resource sharing. We'll use Terragrunt to define the resources in the staging account, and use the trust relationship to enable access to resources in the production account.

## Run Example (Scheduler + Lambda in Prod, Only Lambda in Staging)

Finally, we'll run an example that demonstrates how to use Terragrunt to manage infrastructure in both the staging and production accounts. We'll define a Lambda function and a scheduled event in the production account, and a Lambda function in the staging account. We'll use Terragrunt to apply the infrastructure changes to each account and verify that the resources are created as expected.

## Conclusion

In this article, we've shown you how to use Terragrunt with Github Packages and Github Actions to manage infrastructure in AWS. We've covered the basics of building and pushing a Terragrunt image, writing a Github Actions workflow, and using Terragrunt code to define infrastructure resources. We've also demonstrated how to create a staging account in AWS and use Terragrunt to manage resources across multiple accounts. We hope this article has been helpful and that you'll try using Terragrunt with Github Packages and Github Actions to manage your infrastructure as code.
